# The results can viewed in the graphs outputed by the script.
# The XOR function was not due to the fact that its data set was not seperatable by a
# linear line regardless of the best efforts of the perceptron.  This can also be seen
# in the graphed results.

########## The blue line is the initial state of the percpetron. 'x' = True 'o' = False  This script can be compiled in Python and Python3. ##########
